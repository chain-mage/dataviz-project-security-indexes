# Cyber Index Data Visualization Project

## Updates

For week 11, I have pivoted to a globe that can be rotated by clicking and dragging with the window. I've also added a legend that you can hover over to get rid of all bubbles except the ones that are the color that is being hovered over in the legend. Working with a globe has certainly come with some unexpected challenges. For example, when rotating the globe, the bubbles of the countries that are no longer visible remain visible. I believe I'll have to address this using the z coordinate plane and toggling their visibility that way. Additionally, I noticed that the bubbles are not all visible as some obstuct other even if representing the same country. I also need to make it so the bubbles are not present at all if the average salary is zero. My milestones have certainly changed, and I imagine there will be difficulty implenting a zoom feature later on, but I will try.

## Milestones
* Week 12: Fix bubbles on the globe to only be visible when facing the front and to not obscure one another.
* Week 13: Polish visual elements, ensuring clarity in color, size, and zoom.
* Week 14: Finalize all project features, ensuring everything works smoothly.
