# Cyber Salary Data Visualization Project

## Updates

For week 12, I made a significant amount of progress to make this a scalabe and interactive visualization. Now we can zoom in and out for more visibility. Making the bubble sizes inversly proportional to the amount of zoom applied to the visualization, allows the to scale. Making them smaller, the more you zoom in and vice versa. Which means now we can see areas like europe much better by Zooming in. I also offset the bubbles for each country, so that they are not cocentric and we can see them all clearly. Now that we can zoom in, I also placed the legend in a white box in the top right corner of the screen. Additionally, information no longer appears on the cursor when hovering over a bubble, the information will now appear in an information box in the bottom right corner. I do plan to polish things up a bit. Definitely plan on adding a box in the legend with no-data-strips to let the viewer no, the stripes mean no data. I may also add some code so the area around the globe appears to be in space, using SVG.
