# Cyber Salary Data Visualization Project

## Updates

For week 13, I really wanted to polish up the visual elements of the project. I added a a space background with stars that shift around as the globe is being rotated. I also added a title box and ensured that every thing was responsive and would still function if the window size was adjusted. I also added a colorbox to represent the no-data stripes in the legeng and made the information box in the bottom left more neat and concise when hovering over a bubble. The numbers are now clear, everything is a little more polished, and although I may make a few more adjustments in the future as I interact with the map a little more. The visualization appears to be finished.
