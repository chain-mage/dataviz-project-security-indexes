# Cyber Index Data Visualization Project

## Updates

For week 10, I have successfully pivoted to a project revolving around salaries regarding the world map. The project now consists of a world map with concentric circles representing the salaries of companies of varying sizes. Currently, you can hover over each bubble to find exact numbers and labels. In the future, for clarity, I would like the map to be able to zoom in by continent to allow for better viewing by also having the bubbles dynamically shrink as it zooms; for example, Europe is very difficult to view and hover over exact countries right now. The countries currently with no data have stripes across them. I also want to add borders around countries while that perspective country's bubble is being hovered over. The plan, for now, is to add a legend in week eleven that will fade out other company sizes while hovering over one size's color and adding more color to the globe. Then for interactivity on week 12, I would like to add the zoom feature per continent. Week 13 will ensure the smoothness of the features and possible messing with font sizes and colors for clarity. I also want to make it so that every bubble being hovered over lists all 3 company sizes and averages per country.
